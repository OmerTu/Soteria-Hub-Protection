README: openear

OpenEar seeks to assist in data capture where devices are operating
on multiple channels, or fast-frequency-hopping, etc. It expects
multiple interfaces, preferably one per 802.15.4 channel, to use
and assigns them sequentially across all channels. It optionally
interfaces with a gpsd daemon (reading from a standard serial GPS
device) to add GPS data. Please note that the device name of the
GPS device must be passed to Killerbee using the -g option, 
so that it may be ignored, as otherwise the device initializing 
process will "fuzz" the gps device and daemon. Running it with 
the -d option attempts to log data to a database using the Killerbee 
DBLogger (killerbee/dblog.py). Running it with the -p option includes 
location information in the PCAP using the CACE PPI standard.

Example usage:
sudo python scanner.py -d /dev/ttyUSB0 -p
