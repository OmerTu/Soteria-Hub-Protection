 * \brief  This file defines the user API for the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC.
 *
 * \defgroup grIEEE802_15_4 The IEEE 802.15.4-2003 Medium Access Control Layer
 * \ingroup grModules
 *
 *      This module implements a size and performance optimized version of the
 *      Medium Access Control Layer defined in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. This
 *      standard defines a classic request-confirm protocol for access and control
 *      of a wireless medium. The following schemes have been used to reduce code
 *      size and to increase performance:
 *       -  Requests with an immidiate return do not have an associated confirm
 *          primitive. Many of the request primitives defined in the standard is
 *          of a synchronous nature (immidiate return) and a performance gain is
 *          achieved by removing the confirm message.
 *
 *       -  This implementation can only parse one incomming frame at the time. No
 *          pipelining of frames is possible. This could give a potential problem
 *          during active scan. However, great care has been taken to speed optimize
 *          the frame parser so that the scan can still handle multiple beacons
 *          received after the transmission of the beacon request. The timeliness 
 *          of the scan path is within the LIFS and SIFS defined by the standard.
 *
 *       -  Beaconing and GTS is not supported. These are parts of the IEEE 802.15.4
 *          standard that require considerable CPU time. The adoption of these features
 *          is also limited at the moment. However, the implementation is ready to
 *          have these features added at a later date. The typical cost is a HW 
 *          timer and about 8K bytes of program memory.
 *
 *       -  Relaxed API compliance. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard defines an API that
 *          is far from optimized for 8-bit microcontrollers. Many primitives have
 *          far too long parameter lists and costly items such as 64-bit variables.
 *          Where possible, the API has been optimized at the cost of strict compliance.
 *          At the same time it should be easy for the programmer to see the
 *          resemblance with the standard.
 *
 *       -  Security is not implemented. Security will be added at a later date with
 *          HW accelerator support. Doing AES-128 in FW is a costly affair, and is
 *          better done by an accelerator
 *
