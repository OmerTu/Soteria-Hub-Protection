 * \brief  This file defines the user API to the ZigBee NWK layer.
 *
 *
 * \defgroup grZigBeeNWK The ZigBee Network Layer
 * \ingroup grModules
 *
 *      This module implements a size and performance optimized version of the
 *      Network Layer defined in the ZigBee standard (ZigBee Spec. 1.0). The
 *      implementation has limited functionality, and is not ZigBee certifiable
 *      at this time. However, the functionality provided will enable the device 
 *      (Coordinator, router and end-device) to seamlessly participate in a 
 *      ZigBee star or tree network. Mesh routing has not been implemented.
 *      The goal for the implementation is to show how a device can participate
 *      in a ZigBee network at a very small cost (Program and data memory).
 *      Another purpose is to serve as a training vessel and teaser for those 
 *      who wish to learn more about ZigBee and wireless networking. Atmel also 
 *      provide a fullblown certified ZigBee PRO implementation.
