 * \defgroup grTAT The Transceiver Access Toolbox
 * \ingroup grHardwareInterfaceLayer
 *
 * The Transceiver Access toolbox provides an interface on top of the associated
 * radio transceiver low level driver. The API is tailored to work with a 
 * communication stack as the next higher layer (IEEE 802.15.4, Wireless HART etc.)
