 * \brief  This file implements the API for the AirCapture application.
 *
 * \defgroup applAirCapture The Air Capture Application
 * \ingroup applRzUsbStick
 *
 *      The AirCapture application uses the radio transceiver as a passive
 *      listening device in a network to capture frames on the air and forward 
 *      them to a connected PC over USB. The AirCapture application is also 
 *      capable of doing semi-passive operations such as channel scans, 
 *      injecting frames and jamming channels.
 *
 * \par Application note:
 *      AVR2017: RZRAVEN FW
 *
 * \par Documentation
 *      For comprehensive code documentation, supported compilers, compiler
 *      settings and supported devices see readme.html
