 * \brief  This is the header file for the RZUSBSTICK's command interface.
 *
 * \defgroup applCmdRzUsbStick The RZUSBSTICK Command Interface
 * \ingroup applRzUsbStick
 *
 *         The command interface is implemented as a parser that takes a formatted
 *         string from the USB interface, extracts parameters, and executes the
 *         associated internal command handler. Two types of commands are defined:
 *         -# Synchronous: Most of the supported commands are synchronous. That
 *                         implies that all commands return with a response to the
 *                         caller. The timeout for each command will vary.
 *         -# Asynchronous: These commands are actually non periodic events that
 *                          are defined for the command interface to support. 
 *                          These event-commands are stored in queue that must 
 *                          be polled by the user application to avoid overrun
 *                          situations. A typical asynchronous command is an indication
 *                          from the communication stack.
 *
